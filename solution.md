# Architecture

### Vue version : 3
### Vue Router
### Vuex (Store Management) 

- Application is created is created using vue-cli
- Each Page has seperate route. (for more secure Application we can implement route guard based on permission)
- Right now calulation logic on view page. (If we have multiple use of function so we can create mixin or common factory file.)
- Vuex is used for store management. So data will be accessible on other pages.
